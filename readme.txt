HonestyBoxx displays the HonestyBoxx Widget on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

HonestyBoxx is a service for bloggers and businesses to help them earn money and win new business through their websites.
The HonestyBoxx plugin for WordPress adds the HonestyBoxx question box to posts or pages providing an easy way for website visitors to ask questions of the website owner.

With HonestyBoxx the buyer asks their question and says how much they'd be happy pay â€“ just like the honesty box payment system you sometimes see at small stores. In exchange, professionals get to demonstrate their expertise and build trust so that when the buyer needs a larger piece of work, they'll be the first people they think of.

HonestyBoxx Features:
* Complete managed payment system
* Choice of user interface styles
* Responsive design
* Multi-currency support: choose to receive payment in USD, EUR or GBP


== Installation ==

Upload the HonestyBoxx plugin to your blog, Activate it, then enter your HonestyBoxx Widget Token.
